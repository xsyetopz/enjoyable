# Enioyable

Enjoyable is an application for macOS which allows you to use
controller inputs like a mouse or keyboard.

If you've ever played a video game which only supports mouse and
keyboard input but you want to use a joystick or gamepad, then
Enjoyable will help you do that.

## Enjoyable supports

* Mapping gamepad and joystick buttons to keyboard and mouse actions
* Fine control over mouse movement and scrolling using analog axis
   inputs
* Automatic and dynamic switching between different input mappings
* Downloading and sharing input presets for different applications
* Modern macOS features like resume and automatic termination

Enjoyable is free software written by Joe Wreschnig and is based on
the Enjoy codebase written by [Yifeng Huang](http://nongraphical.com)
and [Sam McCall](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/).

## How to Use

To start, just press a button on your joystick or gamepad, then press
the key you want to map it for. Then press the `▶` button and switch
back to your game. For more details, Enjoyable has a in-application
manual available in Help Viewer via `⌘?`.
